      This is a project made by the
      <a :href="mainSite">University of Bristol Expeditions Society</a>
      during the November lockdown of 2020. It is designed to encourage keen walkers to
      discover new walks in and around Bristol, even for those new to the city. When doing
      these walks, please remember to obey all relevant measures to stop the spread of
      coronavirus, so we can get back to running our normal trips as soon as possible!
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Use the sidebar to view a list of routes, all supplied by keen UBESters. There are
      controls at the top to sort and filter the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on a route to view more information about it, including the option to download a
      GPX file and view the elevation graph. On a computer, when you hover over the elevation
      graph, a marker will appear on the relevant part of the map.
    </p>
    <h2>Get in touch</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any feedback on the site, please do let us know! If youâ€™re a society member,
      send us a message on Discord, otherwise we would be happy to hear from you by
      <a :href="mailto">email</a>.
